### What I want to accomplish in the future

I currently am working very hard towards becoming a useful and great developer to improve the lives of others. I am inspired by my friends, the general public and major tech companies to create all of my greatest works, such as Donut Emulator, PytoolSuite, Game_File_Hub and InvenMania.

### Overview of the last year (2022)

It was a great time having to code open source projects on GitHub. It was a very fruitful year and I commited more regularly that in 2020. Collaboration was started last year. I have to thank all of those who have chosen to follow me and fork my projects, it is much appreciated! With the rise of 2022, I am hopefully looking to commit even more and get more followers, with more major projects in the mix as well!
