## Welcome

Welcome to my open-source webpage. It is place of wonder, a space that is filled with enticing projects, by me and some other people that I have collaborated with! Take a look at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/SmashedFrenzy16) for all of my projects.

### Major Projects

### What I want to accomplish in the future

I currently am working very hard towards becoming a useful and great developer to improve the lives of others. I am inspired by my friends, the general public and major tech companies to create all of my greatest works, such as Donut Emulator, PytoolSuite and Game_File_Hub.

### Overview of the last year

It was a great time having to code open source projects on GitHub. t was a very fruitful year and I commited more regularly that in 2020. Collaboration was started last year. I have to thank all of those who have chosen to follow me and fork my projects, it is much appreciated! With the rise of 2022, I am hopefully looking to commit even more and get more followers, with more major projects in the mix as well!
